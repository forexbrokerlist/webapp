Content marketing is essential for directory websites, but creating engaging blog posts that drive traffic and conversions can be challenging. DirStarter solves this with a powerful feature that lets you mention and showcase tools directly within your blog content using MDX components.

This isn't just about embedding links – it's about creating rich, interactive tool cards that display screenshots, descriptions, and call-to-action buttons, all while maintaining your blog's narrative flow.

## Why This Feature Matters

Traditional directory websites have a clear separation between blog content and directory listings. DirStarter's tool mention system changes this by:

- **Keeping Readers Engaged**: Readers see the tool's name, description, screenshot, and call-to-action without leaving the page
- **Maximizing Monetization**: Featured tools display prominent buttons, affiliate links are automatically included, and rich previews increase click-through rates
- **Boosting SEO**: More internal links, longer time-on-page, lower bounce rates, and schema markup for better search visibility

## How to Use It

DirStarter uses MDX (Markdown + JSX) for blog posts, which means you can embed React components directly in your markdown content. The simplest way to mention a tool is using the tool's slug:

```mdx
<ToolEntry tool="github">
  GitHub is the world's leading platform for version control and collaboration. It's essential for
  any development team looking to manage code efficiently and collaborate seamlessly across
  distributed teams.
</ToolEntry>
```

The component automatically fetches the tool data, displays the favicon, name, screenshot, and handles all the styling. You can also leave the content empty and the tool's description will be displayed instead:

```mdx
<ToolEntry tool="github" />
```

Here are some live examples:

<ToolEntry tool="github">
  GitHub revolutionized how developers collaborate on code. Whether you're working solo or with a team of hundreds, GitHub provides the tools you need for version control, code review, CI/CD, and project management. It's the backbone of modern software development.
</ToolEntry>

<ToolEntry tool="react">
  React changed the way we build user interfaces by introducing a component-based architecture and declarative programming model. Its virtual DOM makes updates fast and efficient, while its massive ecosystem provides solutions for almost any front-end challenge you'll face.
</ToolEntry>

---

<ToolEntry tool="jest">
  Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality, and Jest makes it enjoyable. With zero configuration, intelligent snapshots, and parallel test execution, Jest has become the go-to testing framework for JavaScript projects. Its excellent error messages help you fix bugs faster.
</ToolEntry>

<ToolEntry tool="postman">
  Postman simplifies API development by providing a comprehensive platform for designing, testing, and documenting APIs. Teams use it to collaborate on API development, automate testing workflows, and maintain API documentation that stays in sync with their code.
</ToolEntry>

<ToolEntry tool="claude">
  Claude represents the next generation of AI assistants, offering nuanced understanding and thoughtful responses. Unlike other AI tools, Claude excels at maintaining context in long conversations and providing detailed, well-reasoned answers to complex questions.
</ToolEntry>

## Best Practices

**Tell a Story**: Don't just list tools – weave them into your narrative. Explain why each tool matters in the context of your article's topic.

**Add Value with Context**: The content you write inside `<ToolEntry>` tags should provide context that isn't already in the tool's description. Share personal experience, how it compares to alternatives, or specific use cases where it excels.

**Strategic Placement**: Separate tool entries with horizontal rules (`---`) for visual separation, and include enough content between them to maintain readability.

**Balance Quantity**: Use 3-5 tools for focused articles, 5-10 for comprehensive guides, and 10+ only for ultimate roundups where each tool is distinctly different.

## Configuration

You can enable or disable tool mentions globally in `config/blog.ts` file:

```typescript
export const blogConfig = {
  toolsMentioned: {
    enabled: true, // Set to false to disable tool mentions
  },
}
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Product Comparisons**: Create detailed comparison articles where each tool gets a dedicated mention with pros, cons, and specific use cases
- **Tutorial Content**: Mention relevant tools at each step of your tutorial as they become relevant to the workflow
- **"Best Of" Lists**: Curated lists are perfect for tool mentions with detailed context about why each tool made your list
- **Industry News**: When discussing trends, mention the tools and companies involved to create opportunities to showcase your listings

The ability to mention tools directly in blog posts transforms your blog from a traffic source into a conversion engine, keeping readers engaged while creating natural monetization opportunities.
